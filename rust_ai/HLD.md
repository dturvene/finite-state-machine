I'll create a Rust program based on the requirements in the PRD. This will implement a stoplight FSM with a synchronized crosswalk FSM using a data-driven approach.I've created a Rust implementation of the stoplight and crosswalk FSM system based on the requirements. Here's a summary of the key features:

## Architecture

1. **Data-Driven FSM Structure**: Each FSM contains:
   - Name string for display
   - Current state (thread-safe with Arc<Mutex<>>)
   - Last received event
   - Vector of transition structures

2. **Transition Structure**: Contains:
   - Event causing the transition
   - Optional exit action function
   - New state
   - Optional entry action function
   - Descriptive text

3. **Three Main Threads**:
   - Timer service thread (sends TIMER events every 10 seconds)
   - Stoplight FSM thread
   - Crosswalk FSM thread

## Key Implementation Details

- **State Machines**: Generic FSM implementation that works with both StoplightState and CrosswalkState enums
- **Event Handling**: Events are routed through channels to the appropriate FSM
- **Synchronization**: The stoplight FSM sends WALK, BLINKING, and DONT-WALK events to the crosswalk FSM
- **Timing**: 
  - RED state sends WALK immediately and BLINKING after 6 seconds (4 seconds before transition)
  - YELLOW state lasts 4 seconds before transitioning to RED
  - Timer events occur every 10 seconds

## Usage

Run the program and enter commands:
- `S` - Start both FSMs
- `B` - Press crosswalk button (transitions GREENâ†’YELLOW)
- `D` - Display current state of both FSMs
- `X` - Exit the program

The program will print timestamped transitions showing the FSM name and transition description as specified in the requirements.

# REPLY 1
the variable from_state is defined inside a conditional in the process_event function and used in another conditional, causing an Rust E0425 error: "Cannot find from_state in this scope" 

# RESPONSE 1
You're absolutely right. The `from_state` variable is defined inside a conditional block and then used outside of it, causing a scope error. Let me fix this issue in the `process_event` function.Actually, I realize the issue is more fundamental. The current approach tries to infer state transitions, but according to the PRD, we need a proper data-driven FSM where transitions explicitly define their source states. Let me refactor this more comprehensively:I've fixed the scope error by properly restructuring the FSM implementation. The key changes are:

1. **Modified Transition Structure**: Now explicitly includes `from_state` field to clearly define which state the transition originates from, eliminating the need to infer states.

2. **Simplified `process_event` Function**: The function now directly checks if a transition matches both the current state and the event, making the logic clearer and avoiding scope issues.

3. **Explicit State Transitions**: Each transition now clearly defines:
   - `from_state`: The state this transition starts from
   - `event`: The event that triggers this transition
   - `to_state`: The destination state
   - Entry/exit actions and description

This approach follows the PRD requirement for a data-driven FSM more closely, where each transition is fully defined in the data structure rather than being inferred at runtime.

The program should now compile without the E0425 error and properly implement the stoplight/crosswalk FSM system as specified in the requirements.
