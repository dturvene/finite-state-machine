You're absolutely right! `crossbeam_channel` is a multi-producer, single-consumer channel, so only one thread will receive each event. I need to restructure this so each thread has its own dedicated channel and explicitly sends events to other threads' channels.Perfect! Now the architecture correctly implements explicit point-to-point communication between threads. Here's how it works:

## Channel Architecture:

### **Dedicated Channels per Thread:**
- **Timer Service:** `timer_tx/timer_rx` - receives EXIT events
- **Stoplight FSM:** `stoplight_tx/stoplight_rx` - receives START, TIMER, BUTTON, DISPLAY, EXIT
- **Crosswalk FSM:** `crosswalk_tx/crosswalk_rx` - receives START, WALK, BLINKING, DONT-WALK, DISPLAY, EXIT

### **Explicit Event Routing:**

1. **Timer Service → FSMs:**
   - Sends `TIMER` events directly to both Stoplight and Crosswalk FSMs
   - Uses `send_timer_to_fsms()` function to target specific channels

2. **Stoplight FSM → Crosswalk FSM:**
   - Sends `WALK`, `BLINKING`, `DONT-WALK` events directly to Crosswalk FSM channel
   - Uses targeted functions (`send_walk_event`, `send_blinking_event`, `send_dont_walk_event`)

3. **Main Thread → All Threads:**
   - Sends `START` and `EXIT` to appropriate thread channels
   - Sends `BUTTON` only to Stoplight FSM
   - Sends `DISPLAY` to FSM threads only

## Key Benefits:

- **Deterministic delivery:** Each event goes to exactly the intended recipient(s)
- **No event loss:** Events aren't consumed by unintended threads
- **Clear communication paths:** Each thread explicitly routes events to specific other threads
- **Efficient:** No broadcasting overhead - events only go where needed

## Event Flow:
- **Timer:** Every 10 seconds → sends TIMER to Stoplight & Crosswalk
- **Stoplight:** State changes → sends WALK/BLINKING/DONT-WALK to Crosswalk
- **Main:** User input → sends to appropriate thread channels
- **Button in GREEN:** 3-second delay, then YELLOW → BLINKING to Crosswalk

This architecture ensures reliable, targeted event delivery between threads as specified in the requirements.

The FSMs are exiting for an unknown event. I want them to exit only when an
EXIT event is received:
```
The FSM process_event function returns -1 when an EXIT event is received, 0 when the event is discarded and 1 when a transition occurs.
```

# RESPONSE 1
I'll update the `process_event` function to return the correct integer values as specified.Perfect! I've updated the `process_event` function to return the correct integer values as specified:

## Return Values:

- **`-1`**: EXIT event received - signals the thread to terminate
- **`0`**: Event discarded - the event is not valid for the current state
- **`1`**: Transition occurred - the event caused a valid state transition

## Updated Logic:

1. **EXIT Event**: Returns `-1` immediately when EXIT is received
2. **DISPLAY Event**: Returns `1` (always processed, though it's a special case that doesn't change state)
3. **Valid Transition**: Returns `1` when a matching transition is found and executed
4. **Invalid Event**: Returns `0` when no matching transition exists for the current state

## Thread Handling:

Both FSM threads now check the return value:
- If `result == -1`, they print the exit message and break from their event loops
- If `result == 1`, a transition occurred (or display was shown)
- If `result == 0`, the event was discarded (normal behavior for invalid events)

This provides clear feedback about event processing and ensures proper thread termination when EXIT events are received.

I had some bad logic in the original PRD causing the crosswalk BLINKING state to never be entered:
```
Add another state to the stoplight FSM: in the RED state when there are four seconds left send a BLINKING event to the crosswalk FSM.
```

I'll add a RED_BLINKING state to the stoplight FSM that occurs 4 seconds before transitioning from RED to GREEN, and sends a BLINKING event to the crosswalk FSM.Wait, I need to reconsider this approach. The timer sends events every 10 seconds, but I need the RED state to transition after 6 seconds to RED_BLINKING, then after 4 more seconds to GREEN. Let me fix this by using a different approach - I'll create an internal timer mechanism within the RED state.Perfect! I've added the RED_BLINKING state to the stoplight FSM with the following behavior:

## New State Machine Flow:

1. **YELLOW → RED**: 
   - Enters RED state and immediately sends WALK event to crosswalk
   - Spawns internal timer thread that waits 6 seconds

2. **RED → RED_BLINKING** (after 6 seconds):
   - Internal timer sends TIMER event to trigger this transition
   - Sends BLINKING event to crosswalk FSM (4 seconds warning)

3. **RED_BLINKING → GREEN** (after 4 more seconds):
   - Regular 10-second timer triggers this transition
   - Sends DONT-WALK event to crosswalk

## Key Features:

- **RED state duration**: Total 10 seconds (6 seconds RED + 4 seconds RED_BLINKING)
- **Blinking warning**: Crosswalk gets BLINKING event when 4 seconds remain in RED cycle
- **Internal timing**: Uses spawned thread in `red_entry_action()` to handle the 6-second delay
- **Seamless integration**: Works with existing 10-second timer system

## Timing Sequence:
- **0s**: Enter RED → send WALK to crosswalk
- **6s**: RED → RED_BLINKING → send BLINKING to crosswalk (4 seconds warning)
- **10s**: RED_BLINKING → GREEN → send DONT-WALK to crosswalk

This gives pedestrians a 4-second warning that the walk signal is about to end, improving safety at the crosswalk.
